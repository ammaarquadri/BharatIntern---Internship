### 1. Registration Form
**Description:**
Develop a registration form to sign up and store user information using HTML, CSS, Node.js, and MongoDB. This task involves creating a user-friendly form interface, validating input data, and securely storing the information in a MongoDB database.

**Steps:**
1. **Set Up the Project:**
   - Initialize a Node.js project using `npm init`.
   - Install necessary dependencies like Express for the server, Mongoose for MongoDB interactions, and Body-Parser for handling form submissions (`npm install express mongoose body-parser`).

2. **Create the HTML Form:**
   - Design an HTML form with fields for user details (e.g., username, email, password).
   - Use CSS to style the form for a better user experience.

3. **Set Up the Server:**
   - Create an Express server (`server.js`).
   - Set up routes to handle GET requests to serve the form and POST requests to handle form submissions.

4. **Form Validation:**
   - Add client-side validation using JavaScript to ensure all fields are filled out correctly.
   - Implement server-side validation in the Express route to check data before storing it in the database.

5. **Connect to MongoDB:**
   - Set up Mongoose to connect to a MongoDB database.
   - Define a schema and model for storing user information.

6. **Store User Information:**
   - On form submission, capture the data, validate it, and save it to MongoDB.
   - Provide feedback to the user on successful registration or errors.

### 2. Blog Website
**Description:**
Create a blog website for reading and writing posts using HTML, CSS, Node.js, and MongoDB for data storage. The website should allow users to create, edit, and delete blog posts, as well as read and comment on posts from other users.

**Steps:**
1. **Set Up the Project:**
   - Initialize a Node.js project and install dependencies like Express, Mongoose, and Body-Parser.

2. **Design the Frontend:**
   - Create HTML templates for different pages (e.g., home, create post, view post).
   - Use CSS to style the pages.

3. **Set Up the Server:**
   - Create an Express server (`server.js`).
   - Set up routes to handle different pages (e.g., GET / for the home page, GET /posts/:id for viewing a post).

4. **Database Schema:**
   - Define Mongoose schemas and models for blog posts and comments.

5. **CRUD Operations:**
   - Implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functionality for blog posts.
   - Set up routes and controllers to handle these operations.

6. **User Interaction:**
   - Add forms for creating and editing posts.
   - Implement commenting functionality.

7. **Deploy the Application:**
   - Optionally, deploy the application on a platform like Heroku or Vercel for live access.

### 3. Money Tracker WebApp
**Description:**
Build a money tracker app for managing expenses and income using HTML, CSS, Node.js, and MongoDB. This application should allow users to log their financial transactions, categorize them, and provide a summary of their financial status.

**Steps:**
1. **Set Up the Project:**
   - Initialize a Node.js project and install dependencies (Express, Mongoose, Body-Parser).

2. **Design the Frontend:**
   - Create HTML templates for different pages (e.g., home, add transaction, view transactions).
   - Use CSS for styling.

3. **Set Up the Server:**
   - Create an Express server (`server.js`).
   - Set up routes to handle different pages and form submissions.

4. **Database Schema:**
   - Define Mongoose schemas and models for transactions, categorizing them as income or expenses.

5. **CRUD Operations:**
   - Implement CRUD functionality for transactions.
   - Set up routes and controllers to handle adding, viewing, editing, and deleting transactions.

6. **User Dashboard:**
   - Create a dashboard to summarize financial data, showing total income, total expenses, and balance.
   - Use JavaScript to fetch and display this data dynamically.

7. **Deploy the Application:**
   - Optionally, deploy the application on a platform like Heroku or Vercel for live access.

These detailed steps should provide a clear guide on how to approach and complete each task.
